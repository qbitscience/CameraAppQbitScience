# CameraAppQbitScience
Camera service calling android app in kotlin.
This application uses kotlin for calling Camera service 
in android.
When the application starts it first asks user to 
allow permission for camera.
It contains a button.
When its clicked camera opnes,
now just click a picture and it will be visible 
to your application.
As #startActivityForResult is #deprciated we have used
#registerForActivityResult.
We have not worked on design here.
This is just for tutorial purpose.
